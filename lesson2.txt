ing, you can checkout the commit before you introduced that change, create a new branch at that point, and ccourage you to be bold in sharing your reflections on GitHub. If you're not happy with any of your responses, the best solution is to update that response in one or more new commits. The previous response will still be visible in the commit history, but updating youroWe en perspective over time is part of the learning process! Having a commit history that shows your updating perspective will reflect well on you, not poorly.

That said, if you've written anything in your reflections repository that you are not comfortable sharmmit any other changes you are willing to share to the new branch. Then, by only pushing your new branch, you can keep the changes on your original branch private.
